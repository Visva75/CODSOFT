task 1 - number guessing game 
         (It should choose a random number between 1 and 100, then challenge the player to guess the number in 10 turns. After each turn the player should be told if they are right or wrong, and if they are wrong, 
         whether the guess was too low or too high. It should also tell the player what numbers they previously guessed.)
